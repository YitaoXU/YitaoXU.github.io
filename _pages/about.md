Nice to meet you! I am Yitao Xu, currently a 1st year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. Xiaodan FAN](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xfan/). Before that, I was in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, where I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/mihai-cucuringu). Earlier, I obtained my B.S. degree in Mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

My current research focuses on applying statistical methods and AI to address problems in biology and astrophysics, with a particular interest in immunology and RNA–binding proteins (RBPs).
