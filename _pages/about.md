Hi! I am Yitao Xu (徐义涛), a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. Xiaodan FAN](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/xfan/). My PhD research is supported by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html). Before that, I obtained my Master of Science degree in Statistics from the University of Oxford, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/mihai-cucuringu). Earlier, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

My current research focuses on applying statistical methods and AI to address problems in biology and astrophysics, especially in Immunology and RNA–binding proteins (RBPs).

I enjoy connecting with people across disciplines, whether for collaboration or any other discussion, so please feel free to reach out.
